This is a text file full of words.  A 'word' here is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
Therefore, punctuation counts as part of a word - this sentence begins with a 10-letter word.

Some lines don't have any words on them.

Your goal is to replicate the word-counting behaviour of the unix utility 'wc -w'.  This utility counts the
number of words in the file, and prints the count to standard output, followed by a space, the filename, and 
a newline. No error checking is necessary, unless you'd like the additional challenge.

Name your program word_count.c.  Your program should take one argument - the name of the file to process. For
example, if I run the following command at the prompt:

./word_count input_text.txt

The output should be:

131 input_text.txt
